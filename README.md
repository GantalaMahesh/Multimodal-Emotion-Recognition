# 🎭 End-to-End Multimodal Emotion Recognition Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to **predict a person’s emotion** by combining insights from **three different modalities**:

- **Voice Tone**
- **Facial Expression**
- **Text Sentiment**

By leveraging the power of audio, video, and text together, the model achieves more robust and accurate emotion recognition.

## 🧠 What It Does

Predicts human emotions using:

- 🎙️ **Audio signals** (e.g., tone, pitch)
- 🎥 **Visual cues** (e.g., facial expressions)
- 📝 **Textual content** (e.g., spoken/written words)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Model Architecture

### 🎧 Audio Modality

- **Feature Extraction**: MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- **Model**: Convolutional Neural Network (**CNN**)

### 📹 Video Modality

- **Feature Extraction**: Frame-wise facial features
- **Model**: **CNN + LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory)

### 🗨️ Text Modality

- **Model**: Transformer-based models (e.g., **BERT**, **RoBERTa**) for sentiment and contextual analysis

---

## ✅ Multimodal Fusion

All three modality outputs are combined to make a final emotion prediction using a **fusion layer** (can be concatenation + dense layers or attention-based fusion).
